## Lesson 2. Building User Interfaces

NativeScript apps do not use a browser and do not have a DOM; therefore, familiar web elements like `<div>` and `<span>` simply do not work.

Instead, NativeScript provides an [extensive suite of UI elements](http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/ui-views), each of which is implemented with native iOS and Android controls. The advantage of this approach is you get the performance youâ€™d expect from using native user interface components. Letâ€™s look at how they work.

### Step 3. Using NativeScriptâ€™s User Interface Components

In this step youâ€™re going to add a few basic user interface components. Letâ€™s start by simplifying the current app.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your appâ€™s `app/home/home.component.ts` file and replace its contents with the code below.

``` HTML
<ActionBar title="ðŸš€ NativeScript ðŸš€"></ActionBar>

<StackLayout>
    <Label text="Hello world ðŸŒŽ"></Label>
</StackLayout>
```

* **b**. Save your files.

After your app refreshes, you should see the following.

![](images/android-4.png)

<hr data-action="end" />

This example makes use of three different NativeScript user interfaces componentsâ€”`<ActionBar>`, `<StackLayout>`, and `<Label>`. Under the hood, NativeScript renders a native iOS and Android control for each of these. For example, NativeScript uses an `android.widget.Toolbar` and `UIView` to render your `<ActionBar>` on iOS and Android, respectively.

NativeScript allows you to configure these native controls through attributes, such as the `<ActionBar>`â€™s `title` attribute, and the `<Label>`â€™s `text` attribute.

> **TIP**: You can find a full list of the attributes you can use in the [NativeScript API documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/globals).

The [NativeScript component documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/components) is a great reference, as it lists each and every component that NativeScript offers out of the box, but letâ€™s look at how you can experiment with these components directly within Playground.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Locate the **Components** pane in Playground.

* **b.** Using your mouse, drag the **Image** component into your `app/home/home.component.html` file, and place it directly after the existing label. Refer to the gif below to see this in action.

* **c.** Save your files. You should now see the following image on your devices.

![](images/ios-5.png)
![](images/android-5.png)

<hr data-action="end" />

You may want to take a second to experiment with other components in the **Components** pane. When youâ€™re ready, letâ€™s move on to discuss how to control the look of those components.

### Step 4. Styling Your UIs with CSS

NativeScript uses a [subset of CSS](http://docs.nativescript.org/styling) to change the visual appearance of your UI components.

Why a subset? In NativeScript youâ€™re building native iOS and Android apps, and some CSS properties either arenâ€™t possible to replicate with native iOS and Android APIs, or would incur too great of a performance penalty. Donâ€™t worry though; most common CSS properties are supported, and the CSS language syntax is the sameâ€”so styling native apps in NativeScript really does feel like styling web apps.

> **TIP**: The NativeScript docs have [a full list of the supported CSS properties you can use](http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling#supported-css-properties).

Letâ€™s look at how CSS in NativeScript works by styling your appâ€™s components.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your appâ€™s `app/home/home.component.ts` file and replace its contents with the code below.

``` HTML
<ActionBar title="ðŸŽ¨ NativeScript ðŸŽ¨"></ActionBar>

<StackLayout>
    <Label class="my-label" text="Tap the button"></Label>
    <Button text="Tap me!"></Button>
</StackLayout>
```

* **b.** Save your files. You should see the following UI on your devices.

![](images/ios-6.png)
![](images/android-6.png)

* **c.** To start to style this app, open your `app/home/home.component.css` file, and replace its contents with the following code.

``` CSS
.my-label {
    margin: 15 0;
    text-align: center;
}
Button {
    margin: 0 15;
}
```

![](images/android-7.png)

* **d.** Save your files. You should see the following UI on your devices.

<hr data-action="end" />

If you've done any web development before, the syntax should feel familiar here. You select two UI componentsâ€”one by a class name, and one by a tag nameâ€”and then apply a handful of CSS rules as name/value pairs.

Whatâ€™s so powerful here is remember that youâ€™re not styling `<div>`s and `<span>`sâ€”youâ€™re styling native user interface components, and youâ€™re doing so with for both iOS and Android using a familiar styling language.

But it gets even easier. Letâ€™s look at how you can use NativeScriptâ€™s built-in core theme to make your UIs look good with a few CSS class names.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

- Theme

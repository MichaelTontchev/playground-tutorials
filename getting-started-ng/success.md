Now that you’ve learned the NativeScript basics, you’re ready to move on to our next tutorial, which has you built a complete iOS and Android app from scratch.

You can complete that tutorial in Playground, or, if you prefer to work in a local development environment, you can continue in [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick) or the [NativeScript command-line interface](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-1).

As always, if you get stuck, feel free to reach for help on the [**NativeScript Community Forum**](https://discourse.nativescript.org/). Have fun building with NativeScript!

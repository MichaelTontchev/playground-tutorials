Now that you’ve learned the NativeScript basics, you’re ready to move on to our next tutorial, in which you'll see how to build a complete iOS and Android app from scratch. To continue you can:

* **Option 1. Complete the next tutorial in Playground**  
Complete the <a id="btn-next-tutorial" href="/?template=groceries-ng&tutorial=groceries-ng"><strong>Build a Full App</strong>&nbsp;tutorial in Playground</a>

* **Option 2. Start working in a local environment with NativeScript CLI & Playground Preview App**  
If you’re comfortable working with a command-line interface, you can install the NativeScript CLI by running the `npm i nativescript -g` command and then execute the `tns preview` command to preview your work, just as you do in the Playground.

* **Option 3. Start working in a local environment with NativeScript CLI & no limitations**  
If you need to build a production app, you can [do a full install of NativeScript](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup) and start working without any limitations. The NativeScript CLI lets you build full native iOS and Android apps locally on your development machine.

As always, if you get stuck, feel free to reach for help on [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nativescript) or ask our experts in the [**NativeScript community Slack channel**](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation). Have fun building with NativeScript!

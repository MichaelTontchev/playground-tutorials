Now that you’ve learned the NativeScript basics, you’re ready to move on to our next tutorial, which has you built a complete iOS and Android app from scratch. To complete the next tutorial there are several options:

* **Option 1** Complete the next tutorial in the Playground

* **Option 2. Work in a local environment with NativeScript CLI**  
If you’re comfortable working with a command-line interface, you can install and work with the [NativeScript CLI](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup). The NativeScript CLI lets you build full iOS and Android apps locally on your development machine.

* **Option 3. Work in a local environment with NativeScript Sidekick**  
[NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick) is a desktop development tool for building NativeScript apps. Sidekick offers starter templates to help you get started,as well as tooling for more advanced NativeScript functionality, such as plugins, builds, and debugging.

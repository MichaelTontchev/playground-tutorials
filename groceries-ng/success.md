Now that you’ve learned the NativeScript basics, you’re ready to set up a professional development environment to build your apps.

* **Option 2. Continue with NativeScript CLI & Playground Preview App**  
If you’re comfortable working with a command-line interface, you can install NativeScript CLI by running `npm i nativescript -g` and use `tns preview` command to preview you app on real device the same way you do it in Playground.

* **Option 3. Continue with NativeScript CLI & no limitations**  
If you need to build a production app, you can [do a full install of NativeScript](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup) and start working without any limitations. The NativeScript CLI lets you build full native iOS and Android apps locally on your development machine.

As always, if you get stuck, feel free to reach for help on [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nativescript) or ask our experts in [**NativeScript community Slack channel**](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation). Have fun building with NativeScript!

Now that you’ve learned the NativeScript basics, you’re ready to set up a professional development environment to build your apps.

* **Option 1. Continue with NativeScript CLI & Playground Preview App**  
If you’re comfortable working with a command-line interface, you can install the NativeScript CLI by running the 
  ```bash
  npm i nativescript -g
  ```
  command, and then execute the 
  ```bash
  tns preview
  ```
  command to preview your work - just as you do in Playground.

* **Option 2. Continue with NativeScript CLI & no limitations**  
If you need to build a production app, you can [do a full install of NativeScript](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup) and start working without any limitations. The NativeScript CLI lets you build full native iOS and Android apps locally on your development machine.

As always, if you get stuck, feel free to reach for help on [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nativescript) or ask our experts in the [**NativeScript community Slack channel**](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation). Have fun building with NativeScript!

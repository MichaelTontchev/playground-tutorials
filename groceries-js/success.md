Now that you’ve learned the NativeScript basics, you’re ready to set up a professional development environment to build your apps.

* **[Option 1. Download NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick)**  
NativeScript Sidekick is a desktop development tool for building NativeScript apps. Sidekick offers starter templates to help you get started,as well as tooling for more advanced NativeScript functionality, such as plugins, builds, and debugging.

* **[Option 2. Install the NativeScript CLI](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-1)**  
If you’re comfortable working with a command-line interface, you can install and work with the NativeScript CLI. The NativeScript CLI lets you build full iOS and Android apps locally on your development machine.

## Lesson 3. Querying an API to get a Weather Forecast.

In this chapter we will deal with the second section of our application, which in a Vue.js app is often contained in the `<script>` block of a Single File Component.

### Step 4. Get Ready to Query

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Right under the `<script>` tag, add the following three lines, which makes the Geolocation package available for your app.

``` JavaScript
const Geolocation = require("nativescript-geolocation");
const Accuracy = require("tns-core-modules/ui/enums");
const http = require("tns-core-modules/http");
```

In addition to the geolocation package, these calls also import an Accuracy class and http module that you’ll need later on.

Now you can start working on the `data()` method in the `<script>` block. You need to set some default variables so that your screen will be properly populated after the API is queried.

* **b.** Replace the current `data()` method with the following:

``` JavaScript
data () {
    return {
        image: "",
        city: "",
        windSpeed: "",
        summary: "",
        visibility: "",
        humidity: "",
        currentTemperature: ""
    };
}
```

<hr data-action="end" />

Great! Now let’s look at how lifecycle hooks work in Vue.js apps.

### Step 5. Add a Lifecycle Hook

Next, we will add a lifecycle hook—the method `created()`.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Add a comma after the `data()` method’s closing `}`.

* **b.** Copy the code below, and paste it after the `data()` method’s closing comma you just added. This new `created()` method sets some variables you’ll need in your app.

``` JavaScript
created() {
    var currentDate = new Date();
    var day = currentDate.getDay();
    var weekdays = new Array(7);
    weekdays[0] = "Sunday";
    weekdays[1] = "Monday";
    weekdays[2] = "Tuesday";
    weekdays[3] = "Wednesday";
    weekdays[4] = "Thursday";
    weekdays[5] = "Friday";
    weekdays[6] = "Saturday";
    var dayName = weekdays[day];
    var currentHours = currentDate.getHours();
    var timeOfDay = (currentHours >= 12 ) ? "Afternoon" : "Morning";
    this.day = dayName;
    this.time = timeOfDay;
},
```

<hr data-action="end" />

When your app refreshes on device, you'll find two of its elements are already populated, the dayName and timeOfDay. It doesn't look great, but you'll fix that soon.

### Step 6. Get Your Latitude and Longitude

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Before you continue, you need to [register with OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up). Sign up for a free account and create an API key. Your API key may take up to ten minutes to be activated, so be a bit patient. When it is activated, make a note of it as you'll need it below.

Next you’ll need to use the geolocation package that you imported earlier.

* **b**. Start by adding a comma after your `created()` method’s closing `}`.

* **c.** Next, copy the code below, and paste it immediately under your `created()` method. This creates a `methods` block with two new methods: `getMyWeather()` and `parseResponse()`.

``` JavaScript
methods: {
    getMyWeather() {
        Geolocation.enableLocationRequest();
        Geolocation.getCurrentLocation({ desiredAccuracy: Accuracy.high, updateDistance: 0.1, timeout: 20000 })
            .then(loc => {
                if (loc) {
                    var appId = "your app id goes here";
                    var url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=" + appId + "&units=imperial&lat=" + loc.latitude + "&lon=" + loc.longitude;
                    http.request({ url: url, method: "GET" }).then(this.parseResponse)
                }
            },
                function(e) { console.log("Error: " + e.message); }
            )
    },
    parseResponse(response) {
        var location = response.content.toJSON();
        this.city = location.name;
        this.summary = location.weather[0].main;
        this.icon = location.weather[0].description;
        var weatherObj = JSON.stringify(location.main);
        var weather = JSON.parse(weatherObj);
        this.currentTemperature = Math.round(weather.temp).toString() + "°";
        this.humidity = "humidity: " + weather.humidity.toString() + "%";
        var windObj = JSON.stringify(location.wind);
        var wind = JSON.parse(windObj);
        this.windSpeed = "wind: " + wind.speed.toString() + " mph";
        var visibilityObj = Math.round(JSON.stringify(location.visibility)/1609.344);
        this.visibility = "visibility: " + visibilityObj.toString() + " m";
    }
},
```

* **d.** Replace the `"your app id goes here"` string in your code with the app id you created in OpenWeatherMap.

* **e.** Add the line of code below as the first line of your `created()` method.

``` JavaScript
this.getMyWeather();
```

<hr data-action="end" />

You should now see some details coming through in your app, including the city, temperature, and some details about your weather. It still looks pretty awful, but you'll fix that.

> **TIP**:
> * You can set the temperature to be displayed in Celsius by changing `units=imperial` to `units=metric`, in the HTTP request URL.

The app is starting to look more interesting! In the next section, you'll finish the UI.

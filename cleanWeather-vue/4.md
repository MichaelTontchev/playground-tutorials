## Lesson 4. Querying an API to get a Weather Forecast. 

In this chapter we will deal with the second section of our application, which in a Vue.js app is often contained in the `<script>` block of a Single File Component.

#### Action
* **a.** Right under the `<script>` tag, add the following three lines, which make the Geolocation package available for your app.     
* **b.** Similarly, your app will need to set the accuracy of the data, an element that is available in the `ui/enums` package. 
* **c.** Finally, you're going to need to use the `http` module to query the OpenWeatherMap API for data.

```
const Geolocation = require("nativescript-geolocation");
const Accuracy = require("ui/enums"); 
const http = require("http");
```

Now you can start working on the `data()` method in the `<script>` block. You need to set some default variables so that your screen will be properly populated after the API is queried. Replace the current `data()` method with the following:

```
data () {
    return {
		image: '', 
        city: '', 
        windSpeed: '', 
        summary: '', 
        visibility: '', 
        humidity: '', 
        currentTemperature: ''
    };
},
```

> **TIP**:
> * If your pasted code looks unformatted in the Playground, try `ctrl-Z` on Windows/Linux or `Command-Z` on Mac to reformat it.

Next, we will add a lifecycle hook, the method `created()`. Under the final comma closing the `data()` method, add a `created()` method that will set some variables needed in the app:

```
created() { 
    //this.getMyWeather() 
    var currentDate = new Date() 
    var day = currentDate.getDay()
	var weekdays = new Array(7); 
    weekdays[0] = "Sunday"; 
    weekdays[1] = "Monday"; 
    weekdays[2] = "Tuesday"; 
    weekdays[3] = "Wednesday";
	weekdays[4] = "Thursday"; 
    weekdays[5] = "Friday"; 
    weekdays[6] = "Saturday"; 
    var dayName = weekdays[day]; 
    var currentHours = currentDate.getHours(); 
    var timeOfDay = (currentHours >= 12 ) ? "Afternoon" : "Morning"; 
	this.day = dayName;
    this.time = timeOfDay; 
},
```

#### Action
* **a.** When your app refreshes on device, you'll find two of its elements are already populated, the dayName and timeOfDay. It doesn't look great, but you'll fix that soon.

* **b.** Before you continue, you need to register with [OpenWeatherMap](http://www.openweathermap.org). Sign up for a free account and create an API key. Your API key may take up to ten minutes to be activated, so be a bit patient. When it is activated, make a note of it as you'll need it below.

* **c.** Now you can need to finally use the geolocation package that you imported earlier. After the last comma of the `created()` lifecycle hook, create a `methods` block populate with one method called `getMyWeather()`.

* **d.** Make sure to change the APPID in the API call to the one you just created:

```
methods: { 

    getMyWeather() { 
        Geolocation.enableLocationRequest();
	        Geolocation.getCurrentLocation( 
                { desiredAccuracy: Accuracy.high, updateDistance: 0.1, timeout: 20000 }) 
                    .then(loc => { if (loc) 
                        { 
                            /*note, for Celsius use 'units=metric' in the call*/ 
                            http.request({ url: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=<your app id goes here>&units=imperial&lat="+loc.latitude+"&lon="+loc.longitude+"",
	                        method: "GET" })
                        .then( response => { 
                            var location = response.content.toJSON(); 
                            this.city = location.name; 
                            this.summary = location.weather[0].main; 
                            this.icon = location.weather[0].description; 
                            //this.setImage(this.icon); 
                            var weatherObj = JSON.stringify(location.main);
	                        
                            var weather = JSON.parse(weatherObj); 
                            this.currentTemperature = Math.round(weather.temp).toString() + 'Â°'; 
                            this.humidity = 'humidity: '+weather.humidity.toString()+'%'; 
                            
                            var windObj = JSON.stringify(location.wind); var wind = JSON.parse(windObj);
	                        this.windSpeed = 'wind: '+wind.speed.toString()+' mph'; 
                        
                            //convert meters to miles 
                            var visibilityObj = Math.round(JSON.stringify(location.visibility)/1609.344);
	                        this.visibility = 'visibility: '+visibilityObj.toString()+' m'; })
                        } 
                    }, 
                function(e) { 
                    console.log("Error: " + e.message);
	                }); 
                } 
    },             
 ```
You can test this method by uncommenting it out in the `created()` hook. You should see some details coming through in your app, including the city, temperature, and some details about your weather. It still looks pretty awful, but you'll fix that.

> **TIP**:
> * Set the temperature to be displayed in Celsius, by changing `units=imperial` to `units=metric`, in the http request URL. 

The app is starting to look more interesting! In the next section, you'll finish the UI.

Welcome to the NativeScript-Vue playground tutorial for "CleanWeather", a simple weather app. In this lesson, you’ll learn what NativeScript-Vue is, how to use the Playground environment, and how to get your first app onto your device.

### Step 1. Getting Started with NativeScript-Vue Playground
 NativeScript Playground is a browser-based environment for developing simple NativeScript apps. It’s a great place to get started learning NativeScript, as you can develop apps without needing to install the various SDKs and tools needed for native iOS and Android development. All you need to complete this guide is an iOS or Android device. You can follow the [NativeScript-Vue Playground tutorial](https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/getting-started/playground-tutorial/) to run apps on your device using the Playground. 

Let’s see the Playground in action.

#### Action

* **a.** Get out an Android or iOS device. You need at least one device to complete this tutorial.

* **b.** Download and install the **NativeScript Playground** app on your device by either searching for “NativeScript Playground” in the iOS App Store or Google Play, or by using the links below.

One of the biggest benefits of using NativeScript is the fast development workflow. You have the ability to change your code and see those changes instantly—even on multiple devices.

> **TIP**:
> * You can save your current Playground work by clicking the **Save** button at the top. This will generate a URL that you can bookmark for future use.
> * If you want to continue developing this app locally, you can use the **Download** button at the top of the screen. After you download the app you can continue developing using [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick) or the [NativeScript command-line interface](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup).

And with that, you’re running your first NativeScript app on your device! Now that you have your app up and running, let’s proceed to build our CleanWeather app.

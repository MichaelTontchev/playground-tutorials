Now that you have learned the basics, you can set up a development environment to build your apps!

* **Option 1. Continue with NativeScript CLI & Playground Preview App**  
If youâ€™re comfortable working with a command-line interface, you can install the NativeScript CLI by running the `npm i nativescript -g` command, and then execute the `tns preview` command to preview your work - just as you do in Playground.

* **Option 2. Continue with NativeScript CLI & no limitations**  
If you need to build a production app, you can [do a full install of NativeScript](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup) and start working without any limitations. The NativeScript CLI lets you build full native iOS and Android apps locally on your development machine.

If you are interested in learning more about this integration, please visit the #vue channel on [NativeScript Community Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation), read the [docs](http://www.nativescript-vue.org) and read more about it on our [blog](http://www.nativescript.org/blog). Have fun building with NativeScript!
